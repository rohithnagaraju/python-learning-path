# object = if we need to create something we need some goals that goals are objects
# in another word it can defined as a result
# the object contain two things (attribute, behavior)
# attribute = the data which are stored in program using variables and etc.
# behavior = the logic to perform the specific task as a object using attribute
# so to complete  our object we need a planning that is class
# class is nothing but a design of logics and data
# there are inbuilt classes like sting integer float and etc
# so this data types are the planning or design we we are using till know for achieve our object
# we can also able to create our own class using class key word
